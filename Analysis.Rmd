```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The sequences are loaded form Sequences.csv. 4 column A,C,G,T are added. They are empty for now. A column containing only the reference identifier of the column is added.  
```{r}
Sequences = read.csv(file = "Sequences.csv")
Sequences$A = rep(0, 3)
Sequences$C = rep(0, 3)
Sequences$G = rep(0, 3)
Sequences$T = rep(0, 3)
Sequences$Short_Name = sub("(\\S+)(.+)","\\1" , Sequences$Name)
```

The function Nucleotide_count return the difference between the sequence (seq) length and its length after a nucleotide (N) has been removed --> the number of the specified nucleotide. 
The for loops prints the sequence and how many of each nucleotides there is.
It also fills the dataframe with nucleotide counts.
```{r}
Nucleotide_count = function(N, seq){
  return(nchar(Sequences$Sequence[seq]) - nchar(gsub(N, "", Sequences$Sequence[seq])))
                                    }
  

for(i in 1:3){   # for each sequence
  print(
    paste(
      "the sequence",
      i,
      "is",
      Sequences$Sequence[i]
          )
        ) # the sequence is printed
  for(n in c("A","C","G","T")){ # and for each nucleotides
    Sequences[i,n] = Nucleotide_count(n,i)#the count is added to the cell of the dataframe
                              }
              }
```
A table containing the the number of each nucleotides
```{r}
Sequences[,c(1,3:6)]
```

Adds a GC_content column to the dataframe, adds the proportion of (G + C) / length, multiplied by 100 to have it in %.
print a table containing of the GC content
```{r}
Sequences$GC_content = 100*(Sequences$G + Sequences$C)/nchar(Sequences$Sequence)

Sequences[,c("Short_Name","GC_content")]
```
